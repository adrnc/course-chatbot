## General Information

The course comprises the following elements:
* A lecture ("Vorlesung")
* Exercises
* Two tests


## Requirements

This course can only be taken by students of the minor program *"Digital Skills"* who have already passed the 
course *"Grundlagen der Programmierung und Algorithmik"*. Also, student must register to the course in TISS
until October, 10th 2024 (11.59 pm) the latest.  

## Lecture ("Vorlesung")

We use the term *Lecture* (german: *Vorlesung*) to denote the part of the course where new content is presented. 
This will not be organized as a classical lecture (presentation of the lecturer in a lecture hall), but instead
all content will be presented as video recordings (potentially enhanced by additional textual information or 
other materials in TUWEL). The videos, as well as the corresponding slides, will be made available in TUWEL.

New content is published weekly (derivations from the weekly scheme is possible due to holidays, etc; the detailed
plan can be found in the section "schedule"), typically on Thursday evening.

Students work through the provided material on their own account. In principle, there are no strict deadlines until 
each topic must be studied. However, we strongly suggest to follow the weekly schedule and work through each weeks
content within the same week! Trying to work through the whole content all at once will most likely fail. 

To encourage a timely study of the material each thematic block is accompanied by one or two (depending on the
size of the block) quizzes in TUWEL. The performance on these quizzes is included in the overall grade of the course,
and they can only be taken within two weeks after the corresponding content has been released.

Since unfortunately video lectures do not allow you to ask questions or discuss the content with the lecturer,
we offer three tutorial hours per week, that can be used for posing questions, clarifying ambiguities, discussing
the content, etc. These tutorials take place online via Zoom, and are held as unorganized discussions, where 
everyone can just come by at any time and pose their questions. 

## Exercise ("Übung")

The lecture is accompanied by an exercise, that is intended to apply the knowledge presented in the lecture and thus 
to deepen the understanding of these topics. The exercise part is split into two major elements, the TUWEL quizzes and 
the exercisse sheets. 

### TUWEL Quizzes

Each TUWEL quiz consists of a few (not more than six) questions on the topic at hand. The main goal of these questions
is to repeat central concepts of the corresponding topics, and to reward working through the topics. 
They are typically factual questions intended to recall these concepts, or ask to interpret these concepts in very 
simple scenarios. 
Overall, they are neither intended to deepen the nor to check any form of real understanding of the topic, 
but rather if the main points can be reproduced.

As the name suggests, the quizzes are provided in TUWEL, and each quiz can be repeated indefinitely. 
However, points towards the final evaluation are only granted up to the corresponding deadline. Up until then,
the best result achieved so far is included into the evaluation. The evaluation of each take of the quiz is 
visible once the take has been completed.


### Excercise Sheets and on premise exercise sessions

Unlike the TUWEL quizzes, the exercise sheets are supposed to help developing a deeper understanding of 
the topics and to learn how to apply the tools and concepts to solve real world problems. This part of 
the exercise is structured into five exercise sheets. Each sheet is published in TUWEL, and consists of
several tasks. There are two different ways how to complete each task:

1. Instead of a weekly lecture, we offer a weekly exercise session (for the concrete schedule, see below). 
   During each session, a specified set of tasks will be worked on (typically, it won't be exactly the  
   tasks as on the exercise sheet, but highly related tasks). For each task, the exercise sheet will 
   contain detailed information on the exercise session the tasked will be discussed in.

   During the exercise session, you are asked to work on the task. You can do this with the help of both,
   the colleagues present in the session, and the member(s) of the course team present. Also, possible 
   solutions to the tasks will be discussed before advancing to the next task.

   The evaluation of the exercise sessions is based on your active participation, i.e. it must be obvious that
   you are actively trying to solve the tasks. 

   Requirements for an active and meaningful participation in an exercise session include among others
   - students studied the topics of the lecture relevant for the exercise sessions
   - students studied the relevant task descriptions on the exercise sheet at least sufficiently to either have a
     rough understanding on what the task asks for, or can clearly identify specific parts of the task description
     they do not understand.

   When actively participating in an exercise session, then this participation counts as completing the
   corresponding tasks from the exercise sheet. However, there might be certain exercise sheets (especially
   sheet 3), which requires a submission nevertheless.

2. Students can solve the exercise sheets on their own (in this case, solving the tasks is not a group effort, but
   students have to create their own solutions), and submit their solutions via TUWEL. Specific requirements and
   instructions on what and how to submit are provided on the exercise sheet. The submissions will be checked by
   the "Tutor:innen", and the checked (and possibly commented) submissions are returned to the students also 
   via TUWEL.

   The evaluation (and grading) of the solutions is based on the submissions. Submissions are not only evaluated 
   based on their correctness, but also on whether they represent a reasonable effort to solve the task.
   After all, this is an *exercise*, making mistakes is normal. Therefore, especially small mistakes will not lead 
   to a deduction of points. The decision, when points will be deducted, falls to the head of the course. 
   Points will always be deducted if no reasonable effort to solve the tasks can be assumed. This especially includes:
   - syntax and runtime errors in case of code (programs, SQL-queries, ...). Students must make sure that your 
     submissions are executable.
   - Incomprehensible submissions in case of other types of submissions.
   - Missing parts or (sub)tasks

   (This is not a comprehensible list; we have to assume a certain level of diligence from the students when preparing 
    the submission)

   Once the grading is finished, the lecturer may present/discuss a selection of the tasks. This may be provided as
   video, in textual form, or may be excluded completely (this will be mainly based on the qulity of submissions and
   issues identified during the grading).

   Questions on or ambiguities with the feedbacks, marked mistakes, or correct solutions can always be posed 
   towards the course staff. We especially recomment the tutorial hours or the TUWEL boards.

   We explicitly suggest that students look into their feedback - even if the submission was graded with full points,
   since this does not necessarily mean that the submission contained no mistakes: Full points can be granted even in
   the presence of errors!

   Exercise Sheets 3 and 5 are solved in online-tools. They are not graded manually, but checked automatically by
   the corresponding system.


Exercise Sheets are made available well before the corresponding exercise sessions, so students have time
to decide whether they want to join the exercise sessions, or not. Also, the deadlines for submitting the
solutions is always located after the corresponding exercise sessions. I.e. if the session is missed, there
is still the possibility to prepare a submission for the exercise sheet. 

Participation in the exercise sessions or submitting a solution can be freely chosen on a weekly basis, and no
registration or similar action is required.

Sample solutions will be provided for all exercise sheets.


## Exams

The course includes two exams over the semester:
- The *SQL-Test* 
- The *Paper-Test*
(for compatability, we stick to the german names "test" instead of "exam")

Both exams are hold in person (i.e. on premise). Also, for both exams two possibilities to take the exam are offered,
and each student is free to take one or both of the takes. For each exam, the better take counts towards the final
evaluation. 

Both exams are closed book exams, however, certain exceptions apply.

The results on the exam will be made available in TUWEL, and we will announce (also via TUWEL) when the results are
available. Once the evaluation of the exams is finished, there will be a possibility to inspect the grading. The 
date for the inspection will also be published in TUWEL once the results are available.

### SQL-Test

The SQL-Test is a computer based exam, that is taken on the PCs in the "Inflab" (Informatik Labor) located on the
ground floor in Favoritenstraße 9-11. The exam will use the same interface as the web-tool for exercise sheet 3.
However, the exam will run in a mode that does not provide internet access or access to any of the exercises.
The "SQL-Test" will take 60 minutes. 
As suggested by the name, the single topic of the exam is to write SQL-queries.

Since there will likely be more students than available PCs in the Inflab, we will offer two timeslots for the exam.
Students choose their slot when registering for the exam.

#### Evaluation

On the SQL-Test, you can receive up to 25 points.

#### Allowed Material

During the exam, an SQL reference is made available through the exam interface. Besides this reference, no further
material must be used during the test.


### Paper-Test

The *"Paper-Test"* is a classical test taken in a lecture hall and written on, well, paper. The exam takes 60 
minutes, and it includes all topics covered in the course.

#### Evaluation

On the SQL-Test, you can receive up to 30 points.


#### Allowed Material

You are allowed to bring one handwritten (by yourself) A4 sheet of paper with personal notes to the exam. 
No further material must be accessed during the test.

## Material

All materials (videos, slides, exercise sheets, ...) are published in the TUWEL.

## Grading and Certificats

A certificate will be issued to all registered students who took at least one of the following actions:

* taking any attempt of the two exams
* handing in one of the exercise sheets one, two or three
* visiting at least three of the on premise exercise groups

### Grading

Overall, 100 points can be reached throughout the course:

- 25 SQL-Test
- 30 Paper-Test
- 35 Exercise Sheets
- 10 TUWEL quizzes

On the two exams, in total 55 can be reached. Students must receive in total at least 28 points on the exam to pass the course.
Also, overall at least 50 points must be reached to pass the course.

The final grade is based on the points reached based on the following rules:

- N5: < 50 points or < 28 points in total on both tests:
- G4: [50 – 61]
- B3: ]61 – 74]
- U2: ]74 – 87]
- S1: ]87 – 100]

### Details on each category

The evaluation of the tests and exercise sheets is described in their respective sections.

#### TUWEL quizzes

There will be 12 TUWEL quizzes over the semester, thus in theory 12 points can be received through these quizzes. 
However, at most 10 of them will be included in the overall evaluation - this thus either allows not to receive
a perfect score on all quizzes, or not to do two quizzes in time.  




## Contact and Questions

Besides acting as a replacement for direct discussions during the lectures, the online tutorials are also supposed to 
work as tutorial hours for the exercises as well as a general possibility to get in contact with the course team.
Besides these live online meetings, the following possibilities exist to get into contact with the course staff (or 
the other students):

- the boards in TUWEL: Please feel free not only to ask questions there, 
  but also to provide answers or participate in discussion otherwise. 
- The course stuff can be reached by E-Mail: gdi@list.tuwien.ac.at

## More Information on the SQL-Test:

The SQL-Test takes place in the "Informatiklabor" ("InfLab") on the PCs located there. The address is
Favoritenstraße 9-11 (same building as the exercise sessions take place - just a little bit deeper inside the building)
In case the rooms are not yet ready when you arrive (i.e.: the door is closed), please don't wait in the small room
directly in front of the doors, but in the bigger waiting area.

The exam uses the same online interface also used for exercise sheet 3 (including al the feedback provided by the tool).
The only difference to the exercise is, that during the exam students have access to the 5 exam questions and an offline
copy of the Postgres Reference. The other examples from the exercise are not available. 
Except this restriction, the interface offers the known functionalities. Students can simulate the exam at home
by choosing "Prfg-Demo" in the online tool. The interface during the exam is identical to the Demo.

Additional material, the use of the students own laptop or any other tool is forbidden (the exam is closed book).
Taking notes on a sheet of paper provided by us is ok. However, the sheet of paper must be handed in before leaving the
room. 
The duration of the exam is 60 minutes, which is timed individually for each person. Once the 60 minutes are up,
no more changes can be made to the queries in the interface. The only action still possible is to hand in the solution.
The exam tool saves to each task the last (and only the last!) solution submitted (just inserting text into the
textbox is not sufficient, the solution must be submitted).
I.e., especially towards the end of the exam, students must make sure to submit the intended solution before the time
runs out.

On the PCs, there is no internet access, the only page accessible is the exam tool. Besides not being possible, 
accessing any other page ist not allwed either. This also includes pages intern to TU (like TUWEL).
Also, the PCs do not provide any other programs besides a browser. I.e., there are no text editors, etc.
Several windows of the browser can be opened. They are arranged automatically, the size of these windows cannot be
changed. Based on the size of the screens, this should allow for a useful work environment.

WARNING: Open new windows only by using links from an existing window: click the link with the right mouse button,
and select "open link in new window" (or "open link in new tab");
When using several windows and tabs, we often experience that students confuse tabs and windows, and thus overwrite
solutions with answers to a different question. We suggest to never have more than question open at the same time.


#### Workflow on site:

Distribution of the students into the two rooms is done spontaneous. Try to look out for waving/organizing 
course staff. In each room, you are handed out a piece of paper with your login information (username/password) for
the exam. Depending on whether a queue forms or not, we hand out the logins either directly at the doors or later
once students sat down. The actual process is chosen based on the current situation - students recognize the 
applied method on whether when entering the room, they are asked by the course staff to provide an ID, or not.
(In case of doubt, the course staff is usually recognizable by the fact that they face the door, and are not looking
for a workstation :-) ).
Once students have entered the room, they can choose any PC (screen/workstation) that shows the exam tool. Students
can just sit down, put an ID on the table, and make somehow themselves comfortable. The ID remains visible on the table
throughout the whole exam.
Once students have received their login information, they can log in (this does NOT start the exam). Students that
don't have login information wait until they are handed to them.

After logging in, students see a screen that summarizes the most important rules for the exam. On the bottom of this
page, there is button "Prüfung starten". Only when clicking this button, the exam - and thus the individual 60 minutes -
start.
In their own interest, students should wait with starting with the test until the room fell somewhat silent. 
The course staff will then make a short announcement (which will be shorter than the typical announcement before an
exam, since all important information have already been delivered in textual form on the start screen mentioned before). 

Once students started their test, they have 60 minutes to work on it.
In case students encounter any technical problem with the system, they should inform the course staff. Don't panic if
resolving issues takes some time - this time can be reimbursed.
Course staff cannot answer any questions regarding the content of the exam (except clarifying a question).

Students can end their exam early at any time. In such a case, students must make sure to hand in their exam and let
this be confirmed by the course staff.
Students are asked to be quiet even after their time has run out (and leave the room quietly), since other students may
still have a few minutes left, and should also be able to concentrate on their exam.

In case of doubt: 
In case the situation becomes a little bit chaotic before the start of the exam, and a student no longer knows what to
do next, or where to get the login information, or whatever, they should just look out for a free workstation at which
the exam enviornment is running, take a seat, and wait until the chaos slows down. Since the 60 minutes are counted 
individually, no negative consequence can occur because of this: in the worst case, the student starts their test late,
but then they also end late (still having 60 minutes).
